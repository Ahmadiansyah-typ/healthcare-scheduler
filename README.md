# Healthcare Scheduler - Cloud Optimization Platform

A web-based platform for simulating and comparing optimization algorithms for cloud healthcare patient-doctor scheduling. Features a clean Halodoc-inspired design with interactive visualizations.

## 🌟 Features

- **5 Optimization Algorithms**: Random, Greedy, DE, GA, DGA
- **16 Test Instances**: T1-T16 (100-400 patients × 10-40 doctors)
- **Interactive Simulations**: Configure parameters and run comparisons
- **Real-time Charts**: Convergence graphs using Chart.js
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile, tablet, and desktop optimized
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time content search with highlighting

## 🎨 Design

Built with Halodoc-themed aesthetic:

- Primary Color: #D8122A (Halodoc Red)
- Clean, minimalist interface
- Rounded corners and smooth transitions
- Inter font family

## 📄 Pages

- **Home** - Project overview and algorithm showcase
- **About** - Detailed algorithm explanations and methodology
- **Training** - Interactive simulation interface with results visualization
- **Reference** - Research citations and references
